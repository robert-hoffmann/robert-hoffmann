# Icon Design Sources

This folder stores editable design source files for desktop icon sprites.

- Keep runtime assets in `public/icons/` (for example: `desktop-profile-icons.webp`).
- Keep design sources here (for example: `desktop-profile-icons.af`, notes, export guides).
- Export updates from `.af` to `public/icons/desktop-profile-icons.webp` when sprite artwork changes.
