Hi there, 

I'm a curious little bugger, who has been making software, web applications, and frameworks for the community and various companies, since before the days of Google ^^

Worked for 10 years behind the scenes, on all levels, on b2b (white label) social media dating site (.NET, Microsoft, Front-End, SEO/SMO/SMM, DevOps, Tech-Lead)

Currently working on: [VS-Copilot Prompts](https://github.com/robert-hoffmann/prompts)

Some of the projects i've worked on in the past

* [PowerToys for OpenAI ™](https://github.com/robert-hoffmann/PowerToys4OpenAI)
  * Chrome plugin :  Custom GPT responses on search engine pages, and full chat IDE with settings and history
* [HeadJS](https://headjs.github.io/)
  * About the only library on the internet back in the day, that would allow developers make responsive/device friendly websites for IE6+ ^^
* [FindUnusedFiles](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RobertHoffmann.FindUnusedFiles)
  * A Visual Studio add-in to help devs clean up huge messy projects
* [T4ResX (and others)](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/itechnology)
