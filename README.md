### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Currently working on PowerToys for OpenAI â„¢
  - This is basically a ChatGPT Pro, for the fraction of the price ^^
  - I provide the interface, and you provide the API key
  - Like this you get integration with Chrome, Edge, Opera GX
   - And a whole bunch of extra functionality
