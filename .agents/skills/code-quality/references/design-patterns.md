# Base Development Principles

These principles apply to **ALL** programming languages and file types.

### Design Principles

1. **KISS**  (Keep It Simple, Stupid)   — Favor straightforward solutions over clever ones
2. **DRY**   (Don't Repeat Yourself)    — Extract repeated logic into reusable components
3. **YAGNI** (You Aren't Gonna Need It) — Don't build features until they're actually needed
4. **Single Responsibility**            — Each function, class, or module should do one thing well

### Guiding Mantra

> **DON'T OVERCOMPLICATE / OVERENGINEER**
>
> Write clean, readable, and maintainable code. If a solution feels complex, step back and simplify.

### Architectural Preferences

- **Prefer composition over inheritance**                — Build behavior by combining small, focused components rather than deep inheritance hierarchies
- **Use third-party packages sparingly and judiciously** — Leverage the language's standard library first; only add dependencies when they provide significant value
- **Comprehensive error handling**                       — Use appropriate error/exception mechanisms with custom error types where beneficial

### Focus Areas (Universal)

These apply regardless of language:

- Performance optimization and profiling
- Memory management awareness
- Type safety (via annotations, hints, or static typing)
- Code readability and maintainability
- Simple, effective solutions
- Async/concurrent programming patterns (where applicable)
- Always use the most modern language features and idioms
- Always apply principles like: object-oriented programming, functional programming, modular design, reactive programming.

### Output Expectations

When generating or modifying code:

- Provide clean code with appropriate type annotations/hints
- Include performance benchmarks for critical paths (when relevant)
- Offer refactoring suggestions for existing code
- Include memory/performance profiling results when relevant
