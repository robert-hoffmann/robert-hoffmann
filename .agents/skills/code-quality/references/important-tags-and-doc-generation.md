# Important
> **Applies to:** All files (`*.*`)

  - **DO NOT REMOVE** relevant comment tags like: BUG, HACK, FIXME, TODO, INFO, IMPORTANT, WARNING
    - These are tags added by developers to indicate specific issues or important notes in the code.
  - There is a special tag `AGENT_TODO`, that when seen in then comments of code, indicates things that the agent should do, or deeply take into account.
    - This explains what changes the agent should make to the code, or what it should take into account when generating new code.
    - Once new code is generated, the agent should replace `AGENT_TODO` with `AGENT_DONE` and add a comment that explains what it did, and why it did it.
      - **Unless** the code is something like a JSON file where any type of tag or comment would actually break the file.

# Document generation
  - **Do not** create summary documents, manuals, or FAQs, unless the user specifically requests such a file.
  - **Do yes** ask the user if they want a such a document, if the changes are significant enough to warrant it.
