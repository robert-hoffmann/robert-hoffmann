# Python Standards (Project-Specific, Non-Formatting, Python 3.12.x)

This reference codifies Python standards for this repository and is aligned to
official Python and tooling guidance current as of 2026-02-14.

## 1. Platform and Environment

- Runtime baseline: Python `3.12.x` only (default policy: `>=3.12,<3.13`).
- Use a project-local virtual environment and interpreter-explicit commands.
- Prefer `python -m ...` or `uv run ...` for command consistency.
- Prefer `pathlib.Path` for filesystem paths, and keep Windows portability in mind.

## 2. Implementation Strategy

- Enforce strong static typing with clean runtime behavior.
- Prefer modern language/stdlib patterns over legacy idioms.
- Use streaming/generator-based processing for large datasets.
- Treat readability and maintainability as hard constraints.
- For non-trivial work, explicitly compare at least two approaches with pros/cons.

## 3. Typing Rules (Modern 3.12 Defaults)

- Annotate non-trivial function parameters and return types.
- Use modern syntax: `list[str]`, `dict[str, int]`, `X | Y`.
- Prefer `collections.abc` interface types (`Iterable`, `Sequence`, `Mapping`, `Callable`) when mutation is not required.
- Prefer modern typing tools where useful:
  - `type Alias = ...` and PEP 695 type parameter syntax in new code.
  - `typing.override` for explicit override intent.
  - `Self`, `Protocol`, `TypeGuard`, `assert_never` for correctness and safe refactors.
- Keep `Any` out of public APIs unless unavoidable; if used, document why.
- Legacy typing aliases (`Optional`, `Union`, `List`, `Dict`) are migration-only, not new-code defaults.

## 4. Data Modeling and Boundary Validation

Choose a model explicitly by layer:

- External input (HTTP/files/env/queues): Pydantic v2 models or explicit manual validation.
- Internal domain containers: dataclasses.
- Configuration/state: validated model (`pydantic-settings` or validated dataclass).

### Option A: Dataclass-focused internals

Pros:
- Lightweight and fast.
- Minimal dependency overhead.
- Clear internal domain containers.

Cons:
- No automatic runtime validation.
- Serialization/parsing requires explicit code.

Defaults:
- `@dataclass(slots=True, kw_only=True)`
- `frozen=True` for value objects where immutability helps
- `field(default_factory=...)` for mutable defaults

### Option B: Pydantic v2-focused boundaries

Pros:
- Strong runtime validation and error messaging.
- Clean parsing/serialization for external data.
- Better contract enforcement at trust boundaries.

Cons:
- Additional dependency surface.
- More runtime overhead than plain dataclasses.

Use v2 APIs only:
- `ConfigDict(...)`
- `@field_validator` and `@model_validator`
- `model_dump()` / `model_dump_json()`
- `TypeAdapter` for non-model validations

## 5. Modern Python 3.12 Features to Prefer

- `match`/`case` when it is clearer than chained conditionals.
- `asyncio.TaskGroup` for structured concurrency.
- `ExceptionGroup` and `except*` when concurrent tasks fail in groups.
- `pathlib.Path.walk()` instead of `os.walk()` for path-native traversal.
- `itertools.batched()` for standard chunking logic.
- `datetime.UTC` for explicit timezone-aware UTC usage.
- `str.removeprefix()` / `str.removesuffix()` for explicit string normalization.

Notes:
- f-string behavior improvements from PEP 701 are available in 3.12; keep f-strings readable.
- Comprehensions are faster in 3.12 (PEP 709), but readability still takes priority.

## 6. Concurrency Guidelines

- Use async only where it improves the I/O model; do not use async by default.
- For CPU-bound tasks, prefer process-based parallelism.
- For concurrent I/O, use `TaskGroup` (async) or threads where simpler.
- On Windows, guard multiprocessing entrypoints with `if __name__ == "__main__":`.

## 7. Imports and Dependency Hygiene

- Group imports as stdlib -> third-party -> local.
- Remove unused imports quickly.
- Prefer stdlib-first solutions before adding dependencies.
- Add dependencies only when they provide clear correctness/DX/maintenance value.

## 8. Packaging and Toolchain Policy

### Packaging Baseline

- Use `pyproject.toml` as the source of truth for metadata and tool config.
- Include `[build-system]` explicitly to avoid ambiguous builds.
- Keep `requires-python` aligned with runtime policy (`>=3.12,<3.13`).
- Avoid deprecated `python setup.py ...` command execution; use modern build/install commands.
- Nuance: `setup.py` may still exist in some projects, but CLI invocation is no longer the recommended workflow.

### Tooling Stance (Primary + Fallback)

Primary stack:
- Dependency/environment: `uv`
- Lint + format: `ruff`
- Type check: `mypy`
- Tests: `pytest`
- Hooks: `pre-commit`

Fallback options when constraints require them:
- Dependency locking: `pip-tools`
- Type checking: `pyright` or `basedpyright`
- Editor diagnostics: Pylance with `python.analysis.typeCheckingMode = "standard"` for local feedback loops

Operational guidance:
- Prefer one-command workflows for local + CI (`lint`, `format`, `typecheck`, `test`).
- For Ruff, set `target-version` and keep it aligned with `project.requires-python`.
- Keep repository-shared VS Code settings minimal and policy-oriented. Put personal UX preferences (hover summaries, inlay hint style, diagnostics language, UI ergonomics) in user settings.
- If a `pyrightconfig.json` or `[tool.pyright]` exists, treat it as source of truth because it overrides some Pylance analysis settings.

## 9. Function and API Design

- Keep functions focused, composable, and testable.
- Use narrow signatures with meaningful return types.
- Validate boundary data near entry points, not deep in domain logic.
- Add concise docstrings for non-trivial behavior (intent, params, returns, errors, example).

## 10. Architecture and Boundaries

- Preserve layered flow: presentation -> service -> repository -> data.
- Keep domain language consistent between implementation and tests.
- Avoid leaking storage/transport details into domain logic.
- Prefer composition over inheritance when both are viable.

## 11. Error Handling and Observability

- Use specific exception types.
- Preserve root cause (`raise NewError(...) from err`).
- Log decisions and failures with actionable context.
- Use structured logging/context where available.
- Use log levels intentionally (`debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`).

## 12. Testing and Refactoring Practice

- Follow TDD when practical: tests first for behavior changes.
- Keep fast unit tests for logic and integration tests for boundaries.
- Refactor in small, behavior-preserving steps.
- Use guard clauses to reduce nesting and improve readability.
- Use pre-commit hooks to keep routine quality checks automatic.

## 13. Legacy Patterns to Avoid (Migration-Only Exceptions)

- Legacy typing aliases in new code (`Optional`, `Union`, `List`, `Dict`).
- Pydantic v1 APIs (`@validator`, `@root_validator`, `.dict()`, `.json()`).
- New `python setup.py ...` command usage.
- Unstructured dict-heavy contracts where typed models are feasible.

Exception policy:
- Temporary retention is allowed only for explicit compatibility constraints.
- Document what is retained, why it remains, and the follow-up modernization step.
