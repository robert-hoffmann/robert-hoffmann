description: Build, review, migrate, and debug TypeScript codebases using modern TypeScript 5.9.3 syntax and compiler guidance only. Use when creating new TypeScript code, refactoring legacy patterns, reviewing pull requests, updating tsconfig options, selecting module and moduleResolution strategies for Node or bundler apps and npm libraries, and enforcing strict no-legacy output with documented migration exceptions.

# TS Modern

## Overview

Use this skill to enforce TypeScript 5.9.3 modern defaults and patterns across app and library codebases. Generate modern-only output for new code, and allow legacy retention only as a bounded migration exception.

## Load References On Demand

- Read `references/ts-5-9-3-modern-patterns.md` for archetype selection, tsconfig baselines, and modern typing patterns.
- Read `references/ts-5-9-3-legacy-replacements.md` for old-to-new migrations, banned patterns, and exception handling.

## Core Workflow

1. Detect the project archetype from `package.json`, lockfiles, runtime targets, build tooling, and existing `tsconfig*.json` files.
2. Choose module strategy that matches runtime truth:
   - Node runtime: `module` as `node20` or `nodenext`
   - Bundler runtime: `moduleResolution` as `bundler` with `module` as `esnext`
   - Library publishing: prefer Node-faithful resolution for compatibility checks
   - Type-stripping runtime: enforce erasable TypeScript subset
3. Apply strict safety baseline and module hygiene defaults from `references/ts-5-9-3-modern-patterns.md`.
4. Implement modern type patterns first (`satisfies`, `const` type parameters, `NoInfer`, discriminated unions, explicit boundary typing).
5. Reject legacy output for new code and apply migration mapping from `references/ts-5-9-3-legacy-replacements.md` when touching existing code.
6. Validate with available typecheck, lint, tests, and build commands in the target project.

## Version Contract

- Treat TypeScript `5.9.3` stable as the default baseline.
- Do not emit TypeScript `6.x` or beta-only syntax unless the user explicitly requests it.
- Keep recommendations aligned with current TypeScript 5.9 compiler and TSConfig guidance.

## Implementation Rules

### Project Archetype and Modules

- Decide archetype before changing compiler options.
- Keep module settings runtime-faithful, not preference-driven.
- Keep `moduleDetection` as `force` unless a known compatibility constraint requires otherwise.

### Import and Export Hygiene

- Keep `verbatimModuleSyntax` enabled.
- Use `import type` and `export type` for type-only symbols.
- Keep side-effect imports explicit and resolvable.

### Type System Patterns

- Prefer `satisfies` to validate shapes without widening literals.
- Prefer `const` type parameters in reusable APIs that benefit from literal preservation.
- Use built-in `NoInfer` when inference must be constrained.
- Model state with discriminated unions when behavior depends on variants.
- Use `unknown` at trust boundaries, then narrow with validation.

### Compiler Baseline

- Keep `strict: true`.
- Keep `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true`.
- Keep `exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true`.
- Enable `isolatedModules` in toolchain-mixed repos.
- Enable `isolatedDeclarations` for declaration-heavy library workflows.
- Use `noUncheckedSideEffectImports` when side-effect imports are present.

### Tradeoff Handling

- Always propose at least two implementation paths for major TypeScript decisions.
- State concise pros and cons for each option (correctness, compatibility, DX, and migration cost).
- Default to the safest modern option unless user constraints indicate otherwise.

## Legacy-Avoidance Guardrails

- Do not generate legacy experimental decorator patterns for new code.
- Do not generate `namespace`-centric architecture for new code.
- Do not rely on implicit type-only import elision.
- Do not use assertion-heavy shortcuts (`as any`, chained assertions) where narrowing is possible.
- Do not introduce legacy module ambiguity between ESM and CJS.

Migration-aware exception policy:
- Allow temporary legacy retention only for explicit compatibility constraints in existing code.
- Document exactly what is retained, why it is retained, and the concrete follow-up modernization step.
- Scope each exception narrowly and avoid introducing new dependency on retained legacy behavior.

## Output Requirements

When generating or reviewing code, include:

1. Environment note: detected archetype, runtime target, and toolchain context.
2. Version note: TypeScript baseline and any intentional deviations.
3. Decision note: chosen module and compiler strategy with one alternative.
4. Tradeoff note: concise pros and cons for chosen path and rejected option.
5. Legacy note: removed legacy patterns or bounded exceptions with rationale.
6. Validation note: what checks were run and outcomes.

## Completion Checklist

- TypeScript 5.9.3 modern baseline is enforced.
- Project archetype was detected before config or code changes.
- Module strategy matches runtime behavior.
- Strict safety flags are enabled intentionally.
- New code avoids legacy patterns.
- Any retained legacy pattern is documented with a migration path.
- Typecheck and relevant project validations were executed when available.
